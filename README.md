# Arboretum-TDL

TodoList App

Description

This TodoList app is designed to help users organise their tasks efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface to add, manage, and mark tasks as complete.

Do you have a whirlwind of pending tasks to complete, but no way of keeping track of them? 

Look no further. Arboretum is the app for you. 

No longer will you forget to defrost the chicken before rushing off to work, leave the supermarket without picking up a carton of 12 large eggs, or fail to post that all-important birthday card to poor aunt Jemima who still grumbles about the regretful day of 24 Feb 1984 when you forgot (although, in fairness, you had just discovered that your husband used to be a drug lord in Ecuador).

With Arboretum, you can stay on top of your day-to-day tasks. Need to pick the kids up from school? Thanks to Arboretum, you’ll never forget again! It’s an app that can benefit the whole family. 

The concept behind Arboretum is that, with every task you complete, your garden grows. 

Finally managed to destroy the one ring of Sauron? Mark this task as complete and another tree will grow. 

Let your life flourish with Arboretum. 

Buy now! Before you forget - which is very plausible without your Arboretum Task Manager.
